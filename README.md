This book takes place in the universe of Entropic Jesus. 

The story revolves around two friends who develop differing views about the world as they grow into their 30s. Both are very pessimistic and have some resistance efforts that they mutually endeavor on.

Your character sees biblical prophecy as indicating that you were suppose to make a software infrastructure in the cloud which will host a new healthy, functional form of the internet that is free of surveillence and corporate manipulation and domination.

My character has a different view of prophecy and of the world, doesn't have faith that this new form of internet will turn out any differently then the last one (kind of locke vs hobbes-esque dichotomy between your character and mine)

My character thinks that the "god in the clouds metaphor was suppose to mean I should deliver freedom through distributing flash drives via air balloons to the public
So maybe this software is something we developed together but we have different views of how to bring it to the world, my character is convinced that the internet shouldnt even exist, while yours still has faith

so at some point our methods differ and we develop seperate factions of resistance programmers
but my approach ultimately starts a movement that gets lumped in with islamic extremists and the disenfranchised

so we both start secretly, unknowing to what the other one is doing, start sabotaging the other person's efforts, while your character (the entropic jesus) runs ads on your subinternet (which has largely defeated the corporate stranglehold on the internet) against the actions of my faction for being too violent and extreme
So it becomes a situation where the legacy media is trying to associate your efforts with the movement I started with the air balloon flash drive thing
So eventually we reunite and then eventually you find out that I'm the one who started the movement that became this rogue militia resistance against your faction
"we working keeping this all a secret from one another in order to keep our friendship intact."
I havn't worked out an ending yet, but ultimately, all this biblical and philosophy stuff is a backdrop to a story about 2 friends who end up secretly and unknowingly fighting a holy war against each other because we didn't want to tell each other our true feelings cuz we were scared of what the other one would say lol
